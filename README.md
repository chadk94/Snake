# Snake
A classical snake game, spawns fruits and as you eat them your tail gets bigger.
To be played in the terminal window (It does blink a bit so any seizure issues, avoid just in case)
Maintains a high score across sessions via an ifstream of a .txt file.
Settings can be adjusted via const int at time to widen grid. (Snake tail size is hard coded at 100 so will also need to be adjusted for a massive game)
